\section{Personal profile}
As a hands-on Engineering Lead with more than 20 years of experience I have consistently strived to transform Engineering departments to be more reliable, high-performing and autonomous. I am big proponent of automation and have helped transition multiple companies from their hard-to-maintain systems to use autoscaled cloud services, fully auditable infrastructure-as-code setup and CI/CD practices to make their deployments safer while also making them more agile. I have also specific experience in leading Back-End, Full-Stack and Platform Engineering teams and departments between 5-16 people in highly regulated environments like Finance and Gambling.
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
I am also a confident Individual Contributor with technical background spanning key programming frameworks including Ruby on Rails, Spring Boot and React. I also like working on the Platform side, and have experience in setting up cloud systems with AWS, automated deployments and auto-scaling using Kubernetes, and auditable infrastructure-as-code setup using Ansible and Terraform.
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
I highly value mentorship and coaching, and have successfully grown people in AZA Finance from fresh Graduates all the way up to become Technical Leads across the years. I usually like to take a hands-on approach as a manager and I try to actively participate in code reviews, architecture discussions, and debugging sessions to make sure I understand the issues my teams face and hence I can foresee potential risks easier and make better informed decisions about future projects and can suggest better the technical direction the company should make.
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
Throughout my career, I have been committed to fostering a culture of transparency, trust, and innovation. By balancing technical expertise with empathy and strong communication, I create an environment where engineers feel empowered to take ownership and contribute to the broader vision of the company.
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
I am also using my years of experience and teaching skills in multiple Tech for Good charities including CodeBar and Code Your Future. Within these initiatives I'm helping junior developers, fresh graduates and other people coming from disadvantaged backgrounds trying to get into tech. This involves frequent meetups where I'm giving 1-2-1 coaching sessions, as well as being a Technical Educator doing Full-Stack developer classes.
